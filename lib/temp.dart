      '',
      'The most diverse category of shorebirds is the sandpipers. Sizes and colorations range greatly from tiny, bland birds to much larger, distinctly marked species.',
      'All of these birds have sensitive bills they use to probe through the sand or dirt when feeding, and they often eat insects, worms, mollusks, and similar prey.',
      'While there are many species that include “sandpiper” in their name, other species such as turnstones, stints, godwits, curlews, woodcocks, phalaropes, yellowlegs, snipes, and dowitchers are also classified as sandpipers.',
