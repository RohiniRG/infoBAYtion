## **Inspiration**
The Beach theme of the MLH Surfs Up Hack really got us into thinking, that how we can implement an app that can showcase nature and the natural beauty around the beaches and which fulfills your's curiosity to know about these things and our's to work with different technologies. 

## **What it does**
This app tells us about the various creatures and things that fascinate us around the beach. It consists of four different UI screens:
1. A refreshing UI welcome screen with real-time animation.
2. The main screen of the app consisting of various categories that you have a look into
3. Clicking in any of these categories will take you to a whole new card section which gives detailed information about the same.
4. And last is the Info page which shows some information about developers.


## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
1. We managed to build this app within <b>12 hours</b> even with beginners experience.
2. Helped us to escape from the tutorial cycle.
3. Learned how to manage virtually collabration effectively.
4. Used version control locally.


## **What's next for infoBAYtion**
1. To make UI more cleaner
2. Making it more generic and dynamic.
3. Implement real time Tidal wave info based on your location.
4. Implemeting Google Image Search within the app.
5. Add search button to search wthin and outside the app.
6. Game suggestions to play with your loved ones.
7. Hosting on PlayStore.
